Welcome to the Tata Motors Stock Prediction Project! 🚗📈

In this project, we will be using the power of machine learning to predict the future stock prices of Tata Motors. But first, let's make sure we have everything we need to get started.

Dependencies 📚
To run this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6 or higher 🐍
Scikit-learn 🤖
Pandas 🐼
Numpy 🔢
Matplotlib 📊
Seaborn 🌊
Don't worry if you don't have these dependencies installed, we have included a requirements.txt file that you can use to install them automatically.

Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project is the Tata Motors Stock Prices Dataset. It contains information about the daily stock prices of Tata Motors, including the opening price, closing price, and volume.

Preprocessing 🧹
Before we can start predicting, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, scaling the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Training 🚀
We will train our model using the scikit-learn library's support vector regression algorithm. This algorithm is a powerful tool for predicting stock prices, and we can't wait to see how it performs on our dataset.

Testing 📈
To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we will use the mean squared error metric. We will also plot the predicted values against the actual values to get a visual understanding of how well our model is performing.


Our program will preprocess the data, train the model, and test its accuracy. You can also modify the hyperparameters of the support vector regression algorithm to see how it affects the accuracy of the model.

Conclusion 🎉
With this project, we hope to have a better understanding of how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the stock prices of Tata Motors. Who knows, maybe we'll be able to predict the next big boom or bust in the stock market! So let's put on our thinking caps and get to predicting. Happy trading! 🤑
